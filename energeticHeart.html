  <p>This piece means a lot to me, I struggle with words but here's what I can say - every element was intentional, and has a deeper meaning that I invite the viewer to interpret on their own. I made this drawing early in January of this year, and I intend for it to be interactive. </p>
  <p>Here are the simple instructions: Gratitude, Compassion, Humility, Forgiveness, Understanding, Valor (courage to speak Truth to injustice) - pick a specific time in your life when someone who loved you expressed one of these feelings towards you and try to really *feel* that expression in your Heart. Hold it there for a couple moments, and then release that same feeling towards something or someone who's wronged you in the past, then let it go.</p>
  <p>This drawing can be used to aid your imagination to experience the 'unseen' effects of the above Heart-centered behaviors...how they move interact within and outside of the limits of time and space.</p>
  <p>I've known it loosely as The Energetic Heart, and it has helped me personally beyond anything I can say or make sense to the mind. My hope is to give at least one other person a version of this experience that was shared with me. Thanks so much for your time.
