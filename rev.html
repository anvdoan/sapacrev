<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>SAPAC SEAS is proud to present the 16th annual art show, rEVOLUTION: Transformation!</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p>We welcome any medium of art including, but not limited to: painting, dancing, drawing, photography, sculpture, spoken word, and poetry. We also accepted alternative forms of art and healing practice: yoga tutorials, recipes, coloring pages, etc. This show is open for survivors and allies, by survivors and allies during this confusing and isolating time.</p>
<p>The themes of our show, as always, are gender, sexism, sexual violence, empowerment, and healing. The topic of sexual violence can include sexual assault, intimate partner violence, sexual and gender-based harassment, and stalking.</p>
<p>Healing is a process that works in different ways for different people. Creating and displaying art can prove very helpful as a way to promote healing. Artistic expression provides a medium to bring up and process emotions and experiences in a way that can be difficult to discuss otherwise. Now more than ever we hope to provide a platform and resource that brings people together in healing.</p>
<p>Our goal with this event is to create and engage in a supportive community space for survivors where UM student allies and survivors will build empathy and an understanding of sexual violence and healing through the unique creative expression of survivor experiences and perspectives. This event is open to all in the community; everyone is encouraged to share their stories and voices.</p>
