<h2>SAPAC</h2>
<p><a href='https://sapac.umich.edu/'>Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center (SAPAC)</a> is a confidential resource at the Univeristy of Michigan. SAPAC promotes social change and activism on two levels: through the professional services we provide to the University of Michigan community, and through student leadership development wherein students help students as peers. We believe that people of all identities must work together to eradicate sexual assault, stalking, sexual harassment, and intimate partner violence and that this necessitates activism in many areas, including education, advocacy, crisis-intervention, safety-building, bystander intervention, and policy development.</p>
<h2>SEAS</h2>
<p><a href="https://sapac.umich.edu/article/survivor-empowerment-ally-support-seas-volunteer">The Survivor Empowerment and Ally Support Program (SEAS)</a>is SAPACâ€™s tertiary prevention education volunteer program. Tertiary prevention is about creating healing, supportive and empowering spaces for survivors of sexualized violence. Our goal is to not only empower survivors in their healing process but to educate others on how to be allies to survivors of sexualized violence. Tertiary prevention recognizes that healing is not linear and works to promote self care and healing as well as create trauma informed spaces.
