  <p>This drawing was created as a response to the Parson's Challenge prompt for my portfolio. The prompt was to create a piece based on a previous artwork, and I based this off of a piece called "Sharp-Tongued", which explored the narratives fed to women and young girls. This piece was meant as a commentary on the narrative surrounding femme sexuality and the virgin/whore complex. Many of these things are phrases or words that I or someone I love has heard growing up. Unfortunately I'm not actually sure of the dimensions and don't currently have access to the physical piece to measure. The drawing was made with ink and colored pencil on black drawing paper</p>
